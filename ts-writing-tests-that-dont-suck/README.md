# Writing Tests that Don't Suck

Following along with the bombardment of NDC talks. This time, [this talk by David Whitney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7LKslgwxmQ). [Here's the repo](https://github.com/davidwhitney/writing-tests-that-dont-suck-examples) that led me to the talk because I was looking into his profile for that [300-line static site generator he wrote](https://youtu.be/CDcP5e7-NOU?t=2576).

David's examples are in js. In the interest of curiosity and to dive back into the language, I'll attempt to do its equivalent in TS.
